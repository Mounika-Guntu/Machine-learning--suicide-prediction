# Machine-learning--suicide-prediction
 we built a logistic regression and other ensemble classification models for the
prediction of suicide attempts due to alcohol use based on age group and gender. The goal
is to predict the individuals who are more vulnerable to attempt suicide due to alcohol abuse so that
it would help providers to take preventive measures on those individuals such as mental health
programs and counselings. We used Drug abuse warning dataset (DAWN) of 2011 (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/34565/datadocumentation)to perform the
analysis. Through the data analysis, we found that there is a weak correlation between the suicide
attempts and the risk factors alcohol, age, and gender in our dataset. Though our dataset was
imbalanced, we were able to predict the suicide attempts using logistic regression models by applying
various techniques such as SMOTE sampling, feature scaling and other machine learning models such as random forest, SVM, Naive bias, Ensemble models . The results of the multiple models show
that the choice of the model depends on the user where the trade-off between precision and recall
must be made.
